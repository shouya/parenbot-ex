# Parenbot

A bot that completes parents on Twitter.


## Usage

### Authentication

You must export at least two environment variables `CONSUMER_KEY` and
`CONSUMER_SECRET` for the program to work. On the first run, export these two
environment variables and run `mix run --no-halt`. Follow the prompt to
authenticate your twitter account and follow the instruction to get another two
environment variables `ACCESS_TOKEN` and `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET`.

Export these two variable and build the program. Now you're ready to go.
